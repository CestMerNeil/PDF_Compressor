### Code Contributions

#### Branch Naming Convention
- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the coding standards (see below)
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   yarn tauri dev    # Test in development
   yarn tauri build  # Test production build
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   - Use conventional commit messages (see below)
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

5. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   - Create a pull request with a clear title and description
   - Link any relevant issues

## üìã Coding Standards

### Rust (Backend)

- **Format**: Use `cargo fmt` before committing
- **Lint**: Run `cargo clippy` and fix warnings
- **Error Handling**: Use `Result<T, E>` for error handling
- **Documentation**: Add doc comments for public functions
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for new functionality

Example:
```rust
/// Compresses a PDF file using the specified quality level
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `input_path` - Path to the input PDF file
/// * `output_path` - Path where compressed PDF will be saved
/// * `quality` - Compression quality level (0.0 to 1.0)
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(CompressionResult)` on success
/// * `Err(String)` on failure
pub async fn compress_pdf(
    input_path: String, 
    output_path: String, 
    quality: f64
) -> Result<CompressionResult, String> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- **Format**: Use Prettier for code formatting
- **Lint**: Follow ESLint rules
- **Types**: Always use TypeScript types, avoid `any`
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **State**: Use appropriate React hooks for state management

Example:
```typescript
interface CompressionSettings {
  level: string;
  inputPath: string;
  outputPath: string;
}

const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [settings, setSettings] = useState<CompressionSettings>({
    level: "/ebook",
    inputPath: "",
    outputPath: "",
  });
  
  // Component implementation
};
```

### CSS/Styling

- **Framework**: Use Tailwind CSS classes
- **Components**: Use DaisyUI components when possible
- **Responsive**: Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- **Dark Mode**: Support both light and dark themes

## üìÑ Commit Message Convention

Use conventional commits for clear and consistent commit messages:

### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Examples
```
feat(ui): add dark mode toggle to navigation bar

Add theme switcher component that allows users to toggle between
light and dark modes. Theme preference is saved to localStorage
and applied automatically on app startup.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(compression): handle invalid PDF files gracefully

Previously, the app would crash when trying to process corrupted
or invalid PDF files. Now displays user-friendly error message
and suggests troubleshooting steps.

Fixes #456
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run Rust tests
cd src-tauri
cargo test

# Run frontend tests (if available)
yarn test
```

### Test Guidelines
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
